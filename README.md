### Hello, I'm Marlon! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> 


In 2008, my journey as a programmer began with creating bots for the game Tibia, sparking a passion that shaped my career. A few years later, I started a course where I wrote my first programs, and that's when I went down the coding rabbit hole.

Over the years, I have worked on challenging projects at companies around the world, spanning e-commerce, finance and healthcare, always looking for the best and simplest solution to complex problems.

Currently, my main focus is creating complete products that seamlessly integrate front-end and back-end. I most enjoy creating software that not only provides a great user experience but is also built robustly behind the scenes.

In addition to programming, I dedicate my free time to creating content on Instagram and TikTok, with the goal of helping aspiring developers navigate the complexities of the job market.

When I'm not on the computer, I'm usually practicing Jiu Jitsu, reading, hanging out with my wife and three cats, or doing burpees at CrossFit.
