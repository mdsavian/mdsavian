### Hello, I'm Marlon! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> 


I'm a software engineer with over 7 years of experience who loves working on the frontend with JavaScript, ReactJS, and CSS.
I've developed many solutions for different types of business since I started working with technology companies.

I love working on challenging projects that allow me to learn while seeking new knowledge, especially if I'm with people who are passionate about what they do.
